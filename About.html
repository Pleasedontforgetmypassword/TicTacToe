                            <p>
                                I'm a beginner programmer, only learning to program at the start of 2020. Python is my main language.
                                Though, I do know other languages like javascript, etc. If you have seen my Github page, you'll know 
                                that I tend to make discord bots. I'm currently trying to expand my variety of projects, like this one.

                            <p>
                                So Normal Difficulty is really easy. The mechanics of the Ai, is really simple. The Ai gets all the possible
                                moves and randomly plays one of them. You should be able to dominate this Ai, very easily.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Hard Difficulty</h2>

                                This Difficulty is literally unbeatable. It uses a algorithm called <a target="blank_" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a>
                                . This algorithm makes it so this Ai is unbeatable. Good luck getting a win!
                            </p>
                            <h2>Ez Hard Difficulty</h2>

                                Hard difficulty but easier, It also uses a algorithm called <a target="blank_" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a>.
                                But this time, it is slighlty nerfed.
